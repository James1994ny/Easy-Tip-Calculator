# Easy-Tip-Calculator

Easy Tip Calculator was my 2nd completed Android application created using Java, Android SDK, and XML. 

The Easy Tip Calculator application launched a graphical user interface which recieves inputs from the user such as tip %, tax %, size of party, and total amount spent. It then evaluates the amount each person has to pay. There is an emailing option that allows the user to send an email the cost to themselves or others.
